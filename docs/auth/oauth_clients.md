# OAuth Clients
Every application (e.g. game, website) that utilises Epic's official services is issued an OAuth client that is used to identify requests sent to Epic, as well as to set boundaries to what a certain application can access.    

Each OAuth client is issued a client ID as well as a secret.

## Scopes
As of now, Epic have not released their OAuth client service to the public, so all current clients have access to all scopes, and more. Here are the scopes that will be available when it is released:
- Display name of current account and preferred language
- Display names of linked accounts
- List of friends
- Ability to update presence
